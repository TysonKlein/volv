**volv** is a portable and customizable evolution simulator. **volv** uses AI with predisposed behaviours dictated by organism **DNA** to pit organisms against each other. Each organism moves, eats, attacks, flees, mates, and protects offspring to survive, and as unique species develop, they work together to ensure thier survival.
