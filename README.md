volv is a portable, customizable, and educational evolution simulator, using simplified principles of evolutionary biology to show 'survival of the fittest' in action.

volv is in the early stages of development. The [current working build](https://github.com/TysonKlein/volv/blob/master/bin/volv.exe) can be found as an executable in the 'bin' folder.
